# General information

This is the final task of the DOS assembler course by [Ilya Dedinsky](https://github.com/ded32).

My course friend and I wrote two CrackMe program and sent them to each other for hacking.
The programs are similar in its idea: the user must enter a password, if its correct, an inscription corresponding to this will appear. The goal is to receive this message without knowing the password.

# General information

This is the final task of the DOS assembler course by [Ilya Dedinsky](https://github.com/ded32).

My course friend, [Egor](https://github.com/4Locker4) and I wrote two CrackMe programs and sent them to each other for hacking.
The programs are similar in its idea: the user must enter a password, if its correct, an inscription corresponding to this will appear. The goal is to receive this message without knowing the password.

# Egor's program (CRACK.COM)

## How to program works

### Program in action

The program greets the user like this:

![greeting](imagesRDM/greeting.png)

The program is designed in an interesting way, here is an example of its use for understanding:

![work_example_1](imagesRDM/work_example_1.png)

An interesting fact: after answering the last question 'y' (yes), the program freezes and I have to restart DOS (my touchpad has already been erased to the keyboard chips)

### Disassembler analysis

I used Ghidra to disassemble the program. Ghidra is a software reverse engineering (SRE) framework created and maintained by the 
[National Security Agency](nsa) Research Directorate.

#### Main function (Address: 0x0100 - 0x0105)

![mainE](imagesRDM/main.png)

The main function **calls** a single function, that prints an input prompt.

#### Function for printing input prompt (Address: 0x0107 - 0x0112)

![Function for printing input prompt](imagesRDM/2func.png)

The function clears the flag, prints a greeting and an invitation to enter a password.

At the end, a function is **called** to get the password.

#### Function to get password <1<sup>st</sup> attempt> (Address: 0x011b - 0x013b)

![Function to get password](imagesRDM/inputfunc.png)

This function accepts the password using the 0Ah function of 21 interrupt. Please note that the code from address 0x0125 will never be executed, this is how the program works, it will be better seen below.

Here the function is **called** to check the password.

#### Function to check password <1<sup>st</sup> attempt> (Address: 0x013c - 0x0189)

![check password function 1](imagesRDM/checkfunc1try.png)

The content of the function is quite strange, there is some buffer in the middle of it, because of this the disassembler detects some function, although it is unlikely to be a function.
Note, that at the end of the function there is a jump to a "function" in the middle, but the program is designed so that we will never get to it (a function is called before it, which either ends the program by hanging, or returns us to the beginning of the program).

Here **two** functions are **called** (without the function before the buffer):
 - Function to output a new line
 - Function to get the password on the second attempt

#### Function to output a new line (Address: 0x01ea - 0x01f8)

![newine fucntion](imagesRDM/newline.png)

Just a function to go to a new line.

#### Function to get password <2<sup>nd</sup> attempt> (Address: 0x01d5 - 0x01e9)

![Second input function](imagesRDM/secondinput.png)

Similar to the first function for getting the password, we get a prompt to enter the password and enter it.

Next, the function is **called** to check the password.

#### Function to check password <2<sup>nd</sup> attempt> (Address: 0x018b - 0x01d2)

![check password function 2](imagesRDM/checkfunc2try.png)

From the disassembled code we can see that the second attempt will never match the correct password, because cmpsb will perform a large number of iterations due to the large value in CX.

Also here we can see what was said earlier: the program either takes us back and gives us two more input attempts or performs a jmp to an obscure address. 
We understand that this is the memory area where strings are stored that invite the user to enter the password for the whole program:

![memory area](imagesRDM/memoryarea.png)

## Vulnerability 1: buffer overflow

The first vulnerability I found was in this place in the code:

![Vulnerability 1. Part 1](imagesRDM/vuln1a.png)
![Vulnerability 1. Part 2](imagesRDM/vuln1b.png)

At address 0x0120 the user fills the buffer at address 0x0132, where the first byte means the maximum number of characters that can be entered - this is how the 0Ah 21 interrupt function works (see below DOS thelp). 

![thelp 0Ah function](imagesRDM/thelp0Ah.png)

At address 0x0132 we see byte 1e<sub>16</sub> = 30<sub>10</sub> characters user can enter, this is more than the allocated buffer, which means we can change the program code with our input. 
**IDEA:** let's change the address from 0x0113 to 0x0132 at address 0x0143. Then we are comparing two identical strings. This combination of symbols breaks the program:

![solve1](imagesRDM/solve1.png)

This combination restores the source code, but with a converted string at address 0x0143. 

<table>
    <tr>
        <th> BYTE </th>
        <td style="text-align: center"> BE </td>
        <td style="text-align: center"> 32 </td>
        <td style="text-align: center"> 01 </td>
        <td style="text-align: center"> 46 </td>
        <td style="text-align: center"> AC </td>
        <td style="text-align: center"> 8B </td>
        <td style="text-align: center"> С8 </td>
        <td style="text-align: center"> BF </td>
        <td style="text-align: center"> 34 </td>
        <td style="text-align: center"> EB </td>
        <td style="text-align: center"> 23 </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th> ASCII </th>
        <td style="text-align: center"> 190 </td>
        <td style="text-align: center"> 50 </td>
        <td style="text-align: center"> 1 </td>
        <td style="text-align: center"> 70 </td>
        <td style="text-align: center"> 172 </td>
        <td style="text-align: center"> 139 </td>
        <td style="text-align: center"> 200 </td>
        <td style="text-align: center"> 191 </td>
        <td style="text-align: center"> 52 </td>
        <td style="text-align: center"> 235 </td>
        <td style="text-align: center"> 35 </td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <th> KEYBOARD BUTTON </th>
        <td style="text-align: center"> alt + 190 </td>
        <td style="text-align: center"> 2 </td>
        <td style="text-align: center"> ctrl + a </td>
        <td style="text-align: center"> F </td>
        <td style="text-align: center"> м </td>
        <td style="text-align: center"> Л </td>
        <td style="text-align: center"> alt + 200 </td>
        <td style="text-align: center"> alt + 191 </td>
        <td style="text-align: center"> 4 </td>
        <td style="text-align: center"> ы </td>
        <td style="text-align: center"> # </td>
    </tr>
</table>

And we see the message about the correct password :white_check_mark:.

## Vulnerability 2: buffer overflow but more interesting

Let's look at the other two buffers where the user responses are put, they are right next to each other:

![buffers for user](imagesRDM/buffers.png)

Note, that the first buffer holds 0e<sub>16</sub> = 14<sub>10</sub> characters, so it overlaps the second buffer -> we can change the first byte of the second buffer, which means we can change the size of the second buffer.
**IDEA:** Let's enter an incorrect password the first time, and on the second attempt enter such a string that the 11<sup>th</sup> character overwrites the byte at address 0x015b with a larger number. Next, we will answer the question [y/n]? with a string of 22 **'n'** and 23 character **'t'**, thus changing byte **75** at address 0x0173 to byte **74** (**jnz** will become **jz**). Since the first character in our string is 'n', we will return to the beginning of the program, and it remains to enter any password to get the same message.

Like this:

![solve part 1](imagesRDM/solve2a.png)

\*\*Enter\*\*

Type in whatever password you want, I'll type in "stay strong":

![solve part 2](imagesRDM/solve2b.png)

Here comes the long awaited message :white_check_mark:.
